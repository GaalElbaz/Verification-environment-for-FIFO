Designed to verify the fundamental functionality of a FIFO (First-In-First-Out) memory.
The test steps cover initialization, data writing, verification of data writing order, data reading, verification of data reading order, and testing boundary conditions such as overflow and underflow scenarios.
This comprehensive test case helps ensure that the FIFO memory correctly stores and retrieves data in a first-in, first-out manner, adhering to its specified behavior and capacity constraints.

The FIFO consists two global signals - rst and clk.
It has 2 control singals - wr and rd, each one specifiys the operation on the opreator.
we need to make sure that wr and rd are mutually exclusive.
and there is a data signal whichs specifiy the data we will write to the Memory.
For the outputs:
Theres is a dout signal which specifiy the data sent out in a case of a read opeartion.
And there are two control flags - Full and Empty which determines is the memory is full/empty of data.
